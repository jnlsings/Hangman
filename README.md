# Hangman

[Play Hangman Here](https://jnlsings.github.io/Hangman/)

## Vision

Originally I wanted to make an educational music vocabulary hangman game that could be used by teachers and music students in highschool and college. Due to issues addressed later in this document, I was unable to fulfill this vision. Currently the game vocabulary is limited.

## How to Play

Simply enter your letter guesses into the input field until you have revealed the word! At this time guesses are unlimited.

## Who is this for?

Anyone who wants to build their music vocabulary and test their existing one.

## Future additions

- Music dictionary API

  - I was unable to find a music dictionary/vocabulary API and needed to focus on getting the basic game logic working first. As a result, the word database I created is limited. I hope to be able to expand the database in the future.

* Change letter hide/show mechanic

  - Want to hide letters but not the entire div
  - Reveal them by changing the display or visibility, not the background color

* Replace text box with image

* Set a limit to the number of wrong guesses

* For each wrong guess, change the image to show a hangman progression

* Upon loss or win, display image or gif

* Make image/gif progression music related in some way

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Hou Chia, Jerrica Bobadilla, and Jared Morgan for their help making my game logic work.
