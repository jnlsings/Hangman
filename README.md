## Vision

Originally I wanted to make an educational music vocabulary hangman game that could be used by teachers and music students in highschool and college. Due to issues addressed later in this document, I was unable to fulfill this vision. Currently the game vocabulary is limited.

## How to Play

Simply enter your letter guesses into the input field until you have revealed the word! At this time guesses are unlimited.

## Who is this for?

Anyone who wants to build their vocabulary and test their existing one. Currently working with a limited array of voice type terms, will be linking to

## Roadblocks

- No music dictionary API
  - I was unable to find a music dictionary/vocabulary API and needed to focus on getting the basic game logic working first. As a result, the word database I created is limited. I hope to be able to expand the database in the future.

* Unable to get show/hide or display: 'none' to work on letter divs

  - Letters are revealed by changing the background color of the divs that hold them
