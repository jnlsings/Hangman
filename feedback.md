# Feedback

Congrats on satisfying the project requirements! Here's some feedback for you:

## Code Quality

Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?

- Code is generally well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues.
- Take a look at the way I've refactored some of your code. Also, make sure to remove any unused code from your HTML/JS/CSS files!
- In general, I'd not recommend using tag selectors (e.g., h1) to target elements for styling because they are not specific enough and can easily get overridden. Just stick with class selectors instead.

## Technical Requirements

How does the project stack up to the requirements for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in a way that makes sense?

- Your game renders in the browser with no errors and separates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Creativity and Interface

Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI Themes?

- The design looks really good in the browser! I thought the overall design was really neat, although I'd love to see this game being responsive across different kinds of devices.

## Functionality

Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that makes sense?

- The game works without major errors or bugs. You might want to consider making the input case-insensitve, so that, for example, a `c` is considered equal to a `C`.

## Presentation

Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well organized and free of clutter?

- Your readme contains relevant information about the application. Other sections you could include: wireframes and installation instructions. See these examples: https://github.com/esin87/travelogue or https://github.com/esin87/StarTrek_TNG_Trivia_Game

## Additional Feedback

- Take a look at some of my inline comments on your code.
